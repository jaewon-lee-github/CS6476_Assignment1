# 
# **Constraints:**
# 1. The dataset contains n data points, each having d dimensions.
# 2. There are k classes.
# 3. The classifier should be iterated for a specific number of iterations.
# 4. Use only the Python NumPy library for computation.
# 
# **Input:**
# 1. data: A 2D NumPy array of shape (n, d) containing the data points.
# 2. no_of_labels (int): Number of Labels.
# 3. iterations (int): Number of iterations for classifier updates.
# 
# **Output:**
# 
# predicted_labels: A 1D NumPy array of shape (n,) containing the predicted class labels for each data point after the specified iterations.
# 
# **Steps:**
# 
# 1. You can initialize the centroid as a random data point FROM the 'data' input.
# 2. Calculate distances between data points and the centroids.
# 3. Store the nearest centroid and return the predicted labels based on the nearest centroids.

# **2) CENTER CROP:**
# 
# **Problem Statement:**
# 
# The task is to implement center cropping for image preprocessing. Given an input image and a desired crop size, your goal is to perform center cropping to extract a region of interest from the center of the image. This technique can be useful for focusing on specific features or objects within an image.
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
# - The code should use only the `numpy` and `PIL` libraries for image manipulation.
# 
# 
# **Input:**
# 
# A single image in JPEG format.
# 
# **Output:**
# 
# The output is a visualization of the original input image and the result of applying inception cropping to the input image. The original image and the cropped image are displayed side by side in a single plot.
# 
# **Steps:**
# 
# 1. Calculate the center coordinates (y, x) of the image.
# 2. Calculate the half size of the desired center crop.
# 3. Use array slicing to extract the region of interest from the image.
# 4. Return the cropped region as the result.

Implement a function affine_transform(points, rotation_angle, scale_x, scale_y, translation) that applies an affine transformation to the input points. The transformation involves rotating the polygon by the given angle (in degrees), scaling it by the given factors in the x and y directions, and then translating it by the given translation vector.

# 
# **4) GAUSSIAN BLUR:**
# 
# **Problem Definition:**
# 
# You are tasked with implementing a Gaussian blur filter for images. Gaussian blur is a common image processing technique used to reduce noise and detail in an image by averaging the pixel values within a local neighborhood. Your goal is to take a color image and apply a Gaussian blur filter to its grayscale representation.
# 
# **Input:**
# 
# A 3D array representing a color image. The dimensions are (height, width, channels), where channels represents the color channels (e.g., Red, Green, Blue).
# An integer sigma representing the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. The value of sigma determines the blurring strength.
# 
# **Output:**
# 
# A 2D array representing the grayscale version of the input image, converted using the formula: **Y = 0.2989 * R + 0.5870 * G + 0.1140 * B**, where R, G, and B are the pixel values for the respective color channels.
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
# The input image array dimensions: 1 <= height, width <= 1000, channels = 3.
# The value of sigma: 0.5 <= sigma <= 5.0.
# 
# **Note:**
# 
# You should implement the Gaussian blur filter without using external libraries like SciPy or OpenCV. Convolution with a Gaussian kernel should be used for blurring.
# The input image should be first converted to grayscale before applying the blur.
# 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# **Steps to Implement:**
# 
# 1. **Convert to Grayscale:**
# 
#   Start by converting the color image to grayscale. This simplifies the process as we'll work with a 2D array.
# 
# 2. **Create Gaussian Kernel:**
# 
#   Formulate a Gaussian kernel based on the standard deviation (σ). The Gaussian kernel represents the Gaussian distribution used for blurring.
#   
#   The formula for the Gaussian kernel is:
# 
#   **$G(x, y) = \frac{1}{{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \cdot e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{{2 \sigma^2}}}$**
# 
# 
# - `G(x, y)`: The value at position `(x, y)` in the Gaussian kernel.
# - `σ`: The standard deviation that determines the blurring strength.
# - `π`: The mathematical constant Pi.
# - `e`: The base of the natural logarithm.
# - `(x^2 + y^2)`: The squared distance from the kernel center.
# 
# The formula calculates the weight of each kernel element based on its distance from the center, and guides the creation of the Gaussian kernel, which is used for convolution in the Gaussian blur process.
# 
# 3. **Normalize the Kernel:**
# 
#   Ensure the kernel values sum to 1. Divide each value by the sum of all values. This maintains image brightness during convolution.
# 
# 4. **Apply Convolution:**
#   
#   Slide the Gaussian kernel over the grayscale image. Calculate the weighted average of pixel values within the kernel's neighborhood. Replace each pixel with the calculated average.
# 
# 5. **Output Blurred Image:**
# 
#   The image after convolution is the blurred image. It will have less detail and noise due to the Gaussian averaging.

# **5)  SOBEL EDGE DETECTION:**
# 
# **Problem Statement:**
# 
# Given an input image represented as a grayscale NumPy array, implement edge detection using the Sobel operator. The goal is to highlight edges within the image by calculating the gradient magnitude and applying a threshold.
# 
# **Input:**
# 
# A grayscale image represented as a 2D NumPy array. Each pixel value represents the intensity of the pixel, typically ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
# 
# 
# **Output:**
# 
# A binary edge map represented as a 2D NumPy array of the same shape as the input image. Each element of the output array should be either 0 (no edge) or 1 (edge).
# 
# 
# **Task:**
# 
# Load the grayscale image and represent it as a 2D NumPy array.
# Implement the Sobel operator to calculate gradients in the x and y directions.
# Calculate the gradient magnitude at each pixel using the calculated gradients.
# Apply a threshold to the gradient magnitude array to obtain the binary edge map.
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
# The input image will be a square grayscale image with dimensions N x N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000). Each pixel intensity value in the input image will be in the range 0 to 255. The threshold value for edge detection will be a positive integer less than 255.
# 
# **Steps:**
# 
# 1. Convert the color image to grayscale for simplicity.
# 2. Calculate horizontal and vertical gradients using Sobel operators.
# 3. Combine gradients to get gradient magnitude.
# 4. Apply threshold: if gradient magnitude > threshold, pixel is an edge. (Threshold = 150, dont change)
# 5. Return binary edge map.
# 
# Hint:
# 
# Use Sobel Operators as follows:
# 
# Sobel X =   
# \begin{bmatrix}
# -1 & 0 & 1\\
# -2 & 0 & 2\\
# -1 & 0 & 1
# \end{bmatrix}

# -1 & -2 & -1\\
# 0 & 0 & 0\\
# 1 & 2 & 1
